# Description of the case study

Spring 2013 was one of the coldest springs recorded in the Netherlands over the last 40 years, temperatures recorded were 4 degrees below average[^1]. This case study focuses on a short period of mass migration across Belgium and the Netherlands.  We begin the series on 5 April 2013 during a phase of little or no migration, with winds blowing predominantly to the SW.  However during the coming nights weather conditions become very complex with extreme differences in wind conditions at different radar sites, even within this small area and differences at the different pressure levels. At the surface winds in the Netherlands, especially in the North and along the coast, are blowing towards the SW, whereas at higher altitudes winds are blowing towards the WSW, this results in layering occurring at several radar sites, but not all (figure 1).

_**Figure 2**: **Mass bird migration observed on five operational weather radars.** Nocturnal bird migration measured by two operational weather radars in the Netherlands (a. Den Helder and b. De Bilt) and three operational weather radars in Belgium (c. Jabbeke, d. Zaventem and e. Wideumont) on 7 and 8 April 2013 (for locations see pink circles on map, blue circles indicate other weather radars in the vicinity). The size of the pink circles represent the height-integrated bird density (birds/km2) on 8 April 2013 at peak migration. Colours in upper graphs of each subplot indicate bird density (number of birds/km3) with the wind barbs indicating the birdsâ€™ ground speed and direction, lower graphs in each subplot indicate the height-integrated bird density (birds/km2), grey areas in these graphs indicate periods between dusk and dawn.*_

Perhaps the most dramatic night in this time series is the night between April 8 and April 9 (figs 3 & 4). In some cases during this night radar images seem to be so saturated with birds that they are filtered out being mistakenly interpreted as rain. Wind speeds in the area reach 12 m/s and higher, very close to the average air speed of migrating passerines, common on such nights. In areas where the wind is blowing in the direction of intended flight (such as in southern Belgium) this is a huge benefit for migrants, but in areas where the wind is blowing in different direction this can cause birds to veer off their intended course and potentially slow down while trying to compensate for wind conditions.
