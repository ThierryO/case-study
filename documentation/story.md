# Description of the case study

Spring 2013 was one of the coldest springs recorded in the Netherlands over the last 40 years, temperatures recorded were 4 degrees below average .   This case study focuses on a short period of mass migration across Belgium and the Netherlands.  We begin the series on 5/4/2013 during a phase of little or no migration, with winds blowing predominantly to the SW.  However during the coming nights weather conditions become very complex with extreme differences in wind conditions at different radar sites, even within this small area and differences at the different pressure levels.  At the surface winds in the Netherlands, especially in the north and along the coast, are blowing towards the SW, whereas at higher altitudes winds are blowing towards the WSW, this results in layering occurring at several radar sites, but not all (figure 2).
