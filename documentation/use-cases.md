## Use cases for research

Draft list of use cases for visualizations, as recorded during WG3 meeting on February 7, 2014.

* map migrating birds
* bird density
* tracks on radar
* time/direction of movement
* movement/interaction with
  * weather
  * landscape/DEM/land use
  * day/night
  * birds
  * humans
  * post events
  * other birds data
  * aircraft
  * pests/flee
  * tides
  * altitudes
  * seasonal/diel patterns
  * model movements
* altitude
* fat/state of individuals
* identifications
* climate
* resources
* outliers
* deviations from the mean
* cost of transport
* military activities
* disturbance
* validations/gaps in data 
* basemap
* zoom map
* pause/rerun time
* temperature
* wind support
* pressure
